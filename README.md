## Background

In this Challenge, I‚Äôll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I‚Äôll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `credit-risk-classification`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository.**

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your `credit-risk-classification` repository, create a folder titled "Credit_Risk."

4. Inside the "Credit_Risk" folder, add the `credit_risk_classification.ipynb` and `lending_data.csv` files found in the "Starter_Code.zip" file.

5. Push your changes to GitHub.

## Instructions

The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

  * Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

  * Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

  * Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

  * Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Open the starter code notebook and use it to complete the following steps:

1. Read the `lending_data.csv` data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Create the labels set (`y`) from the ‚Äúloan_status‚Äù column, and then create the features (`X`) DataFrame from the remaining columns.

> **_NOTE:_** A value of 0 in the ‚Äúloan_status‚Äù column means that the loan is healthy. A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.

3. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

### Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Use your knowledge of logistic regression to complete the following steps:

1. Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`).

2. Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (`X_test`) and the fitted model.

3. Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance by doing the following:
    * Calculate the accuracy score of the model.
    
    * Generate a confusion matrix.

    * Print the classification report.

4. Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

### Overview of Analysis

  * The purpose of this analysis is to create a model that identifies the creditworthiness of borrowers.
  
  * I used A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company.

  * The dependant variable (y value) is the "loan status," which tells whether a loan is healthy or high-risk.

  * The independent variables (X values) were loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts and derogatory marks.

  * Two diffeent Logistic Regression models were generated by using the original data set and the random oversampled data set to eliminate imbalances. To finish, I compared their results that were collected with the scikit-learn library.

   #### Process
   
   * I first read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame
   
   * I split the data to traning and test sets by using train_test_split. 
   
   * Then, I defined the dependent and independent variables. 
   
   * Next, I created a logistic regression model from the original data. 
   
   * I fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train) to make predictions. 
   
   * Finally, I evaluated the model`s performance.

### Results

 * **Logistic Regression Model with Original Data**

### Summary

 * Analysis show that collected data can be effectively used to train and test the Machine Learning Classification Model. For better preditions solving the imbalance sampling issue is needed.

 * Randomly oversampling the data helps us to get higher balanced accuracy and recall scores. With higher recall value, model can predict risky loans more accurately.

 * With incorrect predictions we have two issues:

  * False positives (where users are flagged as risky, but are actually healthy)

  * False negatives (where users are not flagged as risky but are actually risky)

  * Both cases have its costs. It is important to predict both 1s and 0s. Therefore, model should have good accuracy in terms of both.
